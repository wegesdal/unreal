In vague order of importance,


* Improve colour interface. Use a '--range=' switch so you can set
  min and max in one option. Also allow several colours to be
  specified so you can make colour maps that go from blue to green
  to yellow to orange to red.

* Can't handle VRMLs that use 'ElevationGrid'. Should at least fail
  gracefully when this happens.

* Occasionally grid points on polygon edges seem to fail the test to 
  determine if they are inside the polygon

* Be able to specify arbitrary normal - i.e. --normal=[0.414 -0.414 0]
  instead of just --normal=[+-][xyz]. This will require applying a 
  rotation matrix to all the vertices, but should be straight-forward

* Use 'getopt' for command line parsing

* Make windows binary. Test on other platforms

* Output more image formats. Currently outputs ascii PGM, would like 
  to add binary pgm and PNG

* Fix memory leaks. According to 'valgrind', the matrix resizing 
  functions are introducing memory leaks. I'm not sure how bad these 
  leaks are and have tried to block them but without success.

* Add functionality for rotating and flipping the PGM output. Not
  really necessary as the NetPBM utilities and any image manipulation
  program can easily do this, but it would be nice and it's wasy to do.

* Allow parsing for more mesh types. Preferably by linking to 3rd 
  party parsers.
