If you download this software please let me know (see 'SUPPORT') if:
	1) It actually compiled on your machine
	2) It works with your VRMLs

Installation is via the usual './configure && make && make install'.
Further instructions can be found in 'INSTALL'. For instructions on 
how to run this program, see the manual:

	man ./man/mesh2hmap.1

This program was designed for creating heightmaps from meshes for the
'Tribes' inspired game 'Legends'. Legends uses a 256x256 PNG image as
a heightmap for the terrain. I wanted to make some particular terrain
geometry in a 3D modeller and convert it to a heightmap. 

The program converts a 3D mesh into a 2D heightmap. The mesh is in the
form of vertices and polygons, which are defined by indeces to the
vertices. Currently this program can parse the mesh from a VRML file
or a plain text file using a 'native' file format. VRML is a
widespread format and most 3D formats can be converted to it.

The code is extremely messy, largely undocumented and hard to
understand. Unless you're familiar with C and pointer arithmetic,
don't even try to understand it. This program should be split into
three files: Main; Mesh Parsing; and Heightmap Generation. 

I think this would make a useful Blender export script. If anyone
would like to do this, let me know, and I'll document what the
algorithm is doing in English (see 'SUPPORT').
