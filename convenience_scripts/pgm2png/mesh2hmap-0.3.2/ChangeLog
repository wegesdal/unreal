2006-11-04 version 0.3.2
	- Fixed Makefiles to work with GCC 4.x
	- Rewrote VRML parser so that it can handle DEF/USE keywords

2006-05-06 version 0.3.1
	- Fixed bug where you had to specify min, max and bg. They now
	  take on their default values if not specified.
	- Quick fix for a numerical error in the heightmap equations where
	  near vertical polygons could produce very high or low heights.
	  Each height is now confined within the height range of its
	  polygon.
	
2006-04-19 version 0.3
	- Can now output colour gradient heightmaps
	- Added functionality for setting the background
	- Parser can now parse VRML2 again (broken in 0.2)
	- Added `-v' and `--version' command line option

2006-04-02 version 0.2
	- Fixed background problem with non-rectangular heightmaps. Background
	  is now set equal to minimum value of heightmap
	- Functionality for printing 'raw' heightmaps
	- Added autoconf/automake scripts
	- Split code into 4 files: main, parser, mesh2hmap, and output
	- Parser for 'native' format now handles 3+ vertices per polygon
	- Minor changes to MAN page
	
2006-03-28 version 0.1.2
	- Improved VRML parsing algorithm - removed unnecessary nesting
	- Fixed VRML parser bug - only worked when there was a single space 
	  between label and '{' or '[' delimiter.
	- Fixed VRML parser bug - was reading texture coordinates as vertices
	- Wrote proper groff MAN page - mesh2hmap.1
	- Fixed 'usage' message and added '-h' and '--help' switches.
